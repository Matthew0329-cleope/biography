                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My <i><b>childhood</b></i> was fun because all I thought about was playing. I loved basketball, 
                and my only dream was to become a basketball superstar. During elementary, I was part 
                of our school varsity team from Grade 3 to Grade 6. Even though I was addicted to 
                basketball, I never dropped out of the first section, which I think was something to be 
                proud of. However, I never received any academic awards because I did not participate 
                in academic activities, only basketball. I was a shy kid who never wanted to recite during 
                discussions, and I did not really focus on studying, I just did the requirements to pass. 
                Life in elementary was so fun because there was no pressure or responsibility. My only 
                problem back then was whether I could play in the afternoon since I never took naps. I 
                always looked forward to playing with my friends after school. My parents supported my 
                love for basketball but also reminded me to study. Even though I was not the best 
                student, I was happy with my school life. I enjoyed every moment of playing and 
                spending time with my friends. School was not stressful because I never worried about 
                grades, as long as I passed. Looking back, I realize I could have done better in academics, 
                but at that time, basketball was all that mattered to me. My childhood was simple and 
                fun, and I will always cherish those memories.</div>

                    <h2>High School</h2>
                <p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During <i><b>high school</b></i>, I had no idea what to expect, but I immediately felt the 
                    pressure. My dream of becoming a basketball superstar did not change. However, this 
                    time, I learned to balance academics and basketball. I gained confidence and started 
                    performing better in class, which I think was because of the pressure I felt. Even though 
                    high school was stressful, it was still fun. There were many activities like festival dance, 
                    hip-hop, and sabayang pagbigkas. I was surprised that I participated in all of them 
                    without thinking I could. I had many first-time experiences in high school, making it very 
                    memorable. I felt young, wild, and free. But all that fun turned into a nightmare when 
                    the COVID-19 pandemic began. It ruined many lives, including mine. I lost my passion 
                    because online classes were introduced, and I did not like them. For me, they were 
                    draining since they were mostly paper activities. During the pandemic, I got addicted to 
                    Mobile Legends. Playing ML with friends saved me from depression. We joined 
                    competitive tournaments, and I even dreamed of becoming a pro. After two years, face
                    to-face classes returned. I missed playing basketball and going back to school, but my 
                    passion was slowly fading. The pressure became tougher, and I had no idea which strand 
                    to take in senior high school. Since I was business-minded, I chose ABM because I wanted 
                    to pursue accountancy. I did well in SHS and achieved a lot. I earned honors, was part 
                    of the ABM men's basketball team, and won first place in intramurals. I also won a 
                    pageant, which surprised me because I never thought of joining one. Our section chose 
                    me as the representative, so I had no choice. We passed our business plan research, and 
                    I also passed my individual business plan with a perfect grade. I graduated with honors, 
                    and for the first time, I walked on stage to receive my award.</p></div>

                        <h2>College</h2>
                    <p align="justify"; margin: 20px;>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I am in <i><b>college</i></b>, I am taking the BSIT program, which surprised me 
                        because I never thought about choosing this course. My first choice was nursing, but I 
                        was forced to take this program instead. During my first year, I felt both nervous and 
                        excited. I heard that college was really difficult and that the reality of life starts here. 
                        People also said that college life is fun. My first year was fun because I met new people. 
                        I made new friends, and we did many things to make our college life memorable. 
                        However, college is not a joke. I need to be at school by 7:30 AM, and I go home at night 
                        since I live in Pasig. Traveling is tiring because of the heavy traffic. There are times when 
                        I feel exhausted, but I know I have to keep going. I am proud of myself because I 
                        survived my first year. Now, I am close to becoming a third-year student. But the pressure 
                        is getting heavier because the subjects are getting harder. I am struggling, especially 
                        with design and programming. Some days feel overwhelming, and I doubt myself. Luckily, 
                        I have friends who help me when I need it. College is tough, but I know I must push 
                        through. Now, all I think about is passing and finishing college. I want to graduate so I 
                        can give back to my family. I do not know what the future holds. But one thing is for 
                        sure, <strong>I will make it.</strong></p></div>
